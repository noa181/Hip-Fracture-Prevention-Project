# Hip-Fracture-Prevention-Project
The project's goal is to develop a smart system to prevent falls that could cause hip fracture among stroke survivors. 
We focused on stroke survivors that suffers from hemiparesis with moderate function who live in the community and use walking aids.
The system integrates a smart sensor system in the shoe insoles and a mechanical system of a smart walking cane.
The mechanical system:
