# Hip-Fracture-Prevention-Project
The project's goal is to develop a smart system to prevent falls that could cause hip fracture among stroke survivors. 
We focused on stroke survivors that suffers from hemiparesis with moderate function who live in the community and use walking aids.
The system integrates a smart sensor system in the shoe insoles and a mechanical system of a smart walking cane.
The mechanical system:

The insole system:

Each shoe has a separate sensor system that includes:
4 pressure sensors (FSR), IMU (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope) and a microcontroller connected to a rechargeable battery that wirelessly transmits the data.
As part of the project, we are using the data that was received from the sensors, to identify changes in the characteristics of the patient's gait, that can indicate a danger of falling in a future walking cycle. 
we chose to focus on two gait characteristics - decrease in the walking speed and a rapid deviation of the center of pressure to the side.
When the sensor system detects a future fall, it will send a signal to the mechanical system to activate it, and then the smart walking cane will open its support legs.
